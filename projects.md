**Highlighted Projects**

**Winter 2019 - Modelling Default Rates of Single-Family Mortgage Loans with Multinomial Logistic Regression**: <a href="https://github.com/daveveitch/UofT/raw/master/STA2453/Project%202/FinalSubmission/FinalReport.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="https://github.com/daveveitch/UofT/tree/master/STA2453/Project%202/FinalSubmission">Github repository</a>, <a href="https://daveveitch.github.io/assets/MtgDefaultMNLogit.html">HTML</a>
- The primary goal of this project was to create an interpretable model to predict defaults on the Freddie Mac single-family mortgage loan-level dataset.
- This project was done in collaboration with industry partner CPPIB.

**Fall 2018 - Predicting Fama French Factors Using Machine Learning Techniques**: <a href="https://github.com/daveveitch/UofT/raw/master/CSC2515%20-%20Intro%20to%20ML/CSC2515Project/Report/PredictingFamaFrenchFactorsUsingML.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="https://github.com/daveveitch/UofT/tree/master/CSC2515%20-%20Intro%20to%20ML/CSC2515Project">Github repository</a>
- This paper applies a variety of machine learning models to the task of predicting two of the Fama-French factors, SMB and HML. For each year of predictions the models are trained on the previous four-hundred months of data. Predictions are made for the period of 1988-2018. The performance of trading strategies based on these predictions are assessed. Our results suggest that machine learning models do possess predictive ability for these factors.

**Fall 2018 - Rating the Critics: An In-Depth Look at New York Times Film Critics and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Voting Membership**: <a href="https://daveveitch.github.io/movieproject.html">HTML</a>, <a href="https://github.com/daveveitch/UofT/tree/master/STA2453/Project%201/Final%20Report">Github repository</a>
- This analysis considers three related questions: are film critics from the NYT able to predict box office hits, what kind of storylines do NYT critics favour, and, what best picture nominees tend to win the Oscar.

**Fall 2018 - Toronto’s Evolution of Attitudes Towards Real Estate**: <a href="https://github.com/daveveitch/UofT/raw/master/STA2101%20-%20Applied%20Stats%201/CADRealEstateProject/STA2101%20Final%20Project%20-%20David%20Veitch.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="https://github.com/daveveitch/UofT/tree/master/STA2101%20-%20Applied%20Stats%201/CADRealEstateProject">Github repository</a>
- This report looks to measure the evolution of Toronto’s attitude towards real estate via applying natural language processing techniques (LDA and sentiment analysis) to newspaper articles.
