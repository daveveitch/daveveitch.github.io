I am an MSc Statistics student at the University of Toronto. I am interested in statistics, math, machine learning, economics, and finance. Before my current studies, I completed my undergraduate degree in Commerce at <a href="https://smith.queensu.ca/index.php">Queen's University</a>, and worked at Bank of America as a fixed-income trader. 

My old blog can be found <a href="https://daveveitch.wordpress.com/">here</a>.
