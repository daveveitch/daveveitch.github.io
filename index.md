I am a Statistics PhD student at the University of Toronto. I am interested in applied statistics, machine learning, and finance. Before my current studies, I completed my Master's degree in Statistics at <a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/">UofT</a>, my undergraduate degree in Commerce at <a href="https://smith.queensu.ca/index.php">Queen's University</a>, and worked at Bank of America as a fixed-income trader.
