I recently received my PhD in Statistics from the <a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> (UofT). Before this, I completed my master's degree in Statistics at UofT, my undergraduate degree in Commerce at <a href="https://smith.queensu.ca/index.php">Queen's University</a>, and worked at Bank of America as a fixed-income trader.
