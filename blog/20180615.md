Toronto, being the multicultural city that it is, takes the World Cup very seriously. But who is Toronto cheering for this World Cup? 2016 <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E">Statscan census data</a> can give us a clue.

**The Data**

I originally came up with the idea for this visualization when writing an <a href="https://daveveitch.github.io/blog/20180605.html">article on the 2018 Ontario election</a> that used StatsCan census data. The census data includes information on ‘ethnic origin population’ by census tract (a very small geographical region, in downtown Toronto it would represent only a few blocks). With this data, and a map of census tracts (available from StatsCan in the form of ‘shapefiles’), I set out to map who Toronto would be cheering for.

**The Maps**

Plotted using Matplotlib Basemap. For each census tract I picked the ethnic origin (of countries in the 2018 World cup) that has the largest population. Note that ‘English’ as an ethnic origin dominates the original map, so I have plotted two separate maps, one including English and one without.  Also note, the map would look a little different if Italy had qualified.

As the World Cup progresses I hope to create more maps with only the teams that are left, or create maps for individual games.

Enjoy!

**Reflection/Technical Roadblocks**

Coming off the heels of my election analysis I was more comfortable using pandas/matplotlib which made the analysis easier. This was because I had more confidence in what steps I would need to take in order to get the data into the format I wanted. The biggest technical roadblock, which I ultimately had to ‘hack’ my way around, was the 2016 Census shapefile from StatsCan was incompatible with Basemap (in 2016 StatsCan began to publish these files using a new geographical projection). My multiple attempts to convert it into a compatible file failed, so I ultimately had to revert to using the 2011 census shapefile and interpolate data for a handful the tracts. Not an ideal solution, and I have reached out to StatsCan to get the 2016 file in the proper format so I can update the maps using it as the World Cup progresses.

This analysis once again hammered home the 90%/10% rule; I spent 90% of my time on data cleaning/preparation, and 10% on everything else. All in all, it was a good project for getting familiar with python mapping tools, and practicing data cleaning/prep.
