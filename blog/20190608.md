**Some thoughts on transitioning into 'data science'**

I have spoken with a number of individuals over the past year who, similar to me, did a business undergrad and are interested in 'getting into data science'. What often I get asked is my view on various programs that are offered online or by universities, and what I might recommend as they look to build a skill-set that would enable them to transition into a data science role.

I do not pretend to be an expert data science in industry (I am just in school after all). That being said over the past couple of years I have spoken with numerous individuals within industry, both those who are relatively junior, and those who having hiring authority. As well I have my own experience to draw upon. With this in mind I offer the following thoughts:

**Robust Skills**

Ask yourself what type of skillset you want to get out of an educational program (be it at school or self-study). If you want to build a skillset that is *robust over time* I firmly believe it must include a solid mathematical component. Learning how to program in the hippest new programming language is not particularly hard, and I feel is something that one can pickup easily over time. Understanding math is hard, and requires a huge amount of time and mental effort. Who knows, maybe neural nets are yesterday’s fad in a few years. What I can almost be certain of however is that whatever the next hot machine learning/data analysis/quantitative ‘thing’ is, it is going to require a heavy dose of math and statistics to actually understand. 

**'Paying the Price'**

In my time at UofT I have come to strongly believe there is no 'short cut' to understanding statistics or math. I have also learned that it is more or less impossible to fake understanding these things. I have heard from individuals in industry that within data science 'imposters' are rife (i.e. people who use buzzwords but do not understand what those buzzwords actually mean). If you are interested in developing a skillset that is valuable for data science understand that it requires tremendous time and effort. I think if someone lacks much of a mathematical background from their undergraduate studies (business calculus does not count as a mathematical background) they would be hard pressed to make a successful transition without returning to school (i.e. real brick and mortar school) to take classes.

**University Programs**

One thing that always comes up is the value of an Masters in Analytics/Data Science/AI/ML from a business school which have popped up huge numbers in recent years. If you have an undergraduate degree in math/statistics/engineering I think these programs serve as a means to build a portfolio and land a job since the business schools are very good at getting companies to recruit their graduates. For someone without a degree in these fields I do not see much value in these programs since these programs will teach you algorithms driven by math you will be unable to understand. If you are a mid-career individual who is just looking to learn more about the field (but do not aspire to be a full blown data scientist) I can see some value in these programs, although the price tag seems quite steep (~$60k for some of them) for what you get.

If you lack the math background I would suggest taking a year to fill that in. I did this as a non-degree student at UofT and what I learned in one year served as a solid foundation for my Master's in Statistics.
