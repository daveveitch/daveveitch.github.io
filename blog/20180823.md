In July I was a guest on <a href="https://chemicalstatistician.wordpress.com/">Eric Cai’s</a> YouTube talkshow The Central Equilibrium. In the episode I discuss different sets of numbers (natrual, integer, rational, irrational, real, complex), prove that the square root of 2 is irrational, define injection/surjection/bijection, and finish by proving the rational numbers are countable.

It was a great learning experience for me as it was one of the few times I have ever formally taught math.
